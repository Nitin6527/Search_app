    body: ` A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the
   nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores
   information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best
   known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as
   Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of
   transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it
   guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and
   generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.`,

    body: ` One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is
   how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information
   together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of
   information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when
   filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block,
   forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new
   information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into
   a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain
   once filled.`,
